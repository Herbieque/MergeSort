This project was used to compare the effectiveness of merge sort in relation to bubble sort. 
It was found that, when sorting an array of two hundred thousand integers, merge sort could complete this function in 17 seconds, whereas bubble sort took 29. 
Additionally, for larger array sizes, such as one million integers, bubble sort failed to complete the task at all within a reasonable amount of time, whereas merge sort completed it with no delay, proving it to be superior in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.
